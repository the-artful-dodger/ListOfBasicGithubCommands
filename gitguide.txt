git init    									// TO initialize repository
git add .   									//adds changes either newor modified files ( . means all and add filename.txt means that particular filename 
													to the staging directory between the working copy on the pc and the online repository)
git commit -m "This is our first commit"  		//save snapshot
git log 										//to view list of commits
git status              						//compares working directory with synchronized project to check if there are any changes.
git diff 										// showcases the changes that have been made to a modified file but only changes between system copy and staging area.
													not between staging area and repository
git diff --staged								//showcases differences between staging area and repository

git rm filename.txt								//Removes file from both repository and working copy
												BUT THE CHANGES HAVE NOT BEEN COMMITTED. YOU ALSO NEED TO COMMIT.
												ONLY THE add THING IS NOT REWUIRED.

{
git add newfilename.txt
and then
git rm oldfilename.txt										
}
